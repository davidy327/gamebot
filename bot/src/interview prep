React VS Angular VS Vue:
-- React and Vue for lightweight applications; Vue for more large UI based applications
-- React and Vue use virtual dom while Angular uses real dom
	-- virtual dom creates clones of the UI data and updates the UI when data has changed; don't have to update the entire UI like real dom, only the modified parts
-- Angular uses Typescript
-- React and Vue use Javascript



SQL vs NoSQL:
-- SQL is based on relational tables and algebra; uses predefined structured schemas
-- NoSQL is document structured with key value pairs; uses dynamic schemas
-- NoSQL is very flexible due to using dynamic schemas
-- NoSQL can compute simple queries efficiently

SASS and SCSS:
-- advanced stylesheets based on CSS
-- SASS is based on Javascript 
-- SCSS is like a superset to CSS where you can use all features of CSS and allows you to use more advanced functions
-- Much easier to integrate SCSS to already existing projects than SASS
	-- need to rewrite code for SASS whereas you can add on to CSS in SCSS
-- SCSS is more syntax oriented which means its more strict whereas SASS has fewer constraints
